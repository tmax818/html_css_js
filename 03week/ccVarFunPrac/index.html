      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Log into Codepen if you haven't, then fork this Code Challenge (find
          the Fork button on the bottom right) to your own account.
        </li>
        <li>
          For this Challenge, you will only need to edit the JS panel of this
          Codepen. You do not need to complete every Challenge listed below, but
          try as many as you can in order to get comfortable using variables and
          functions. Read the comments inside the JS panel for further
          instructions.
        </li>
        <li>
          There is one statement that you will see repeatedly in the provided
          code that you are not expected to understand yet. It looks like this:
          <pre>
            document.querySelector("#challengeNum").textContent = someVariable;</pre
          >
          This code's function is to take the return values of each of the
          functions in the challenges and make them appear in the Challenge
          Question Results table. Don't be concerned about this code. You will
          learn how it works later; for now, it's just here to give you visual
          feedback.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Your Challenges:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>This challenge has been completed for you as an example.</li>
        <li>
          Uncomment lines 16 and 17 - that means to remove the
          <b>//</b> characters that are at the beginning of each line. Then
          complete the unfinished variable declaration on line 16 so that it
          calls the <b>getPerimeter</b> function (passing in the numbers 4 and 5
          as arguments) and saves its return value to the const variable of
          <b>perimeter</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Write the <b>return</b> statement inside the
          <b>getOuncesFromPounds</b> function declaration so that it returns the
          value of <b>pounds * 16</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Declare a function named <b>getInchesFromFeet</b> with a parameter
          list containing the parameter <b>ft</b>. Inside the function, return
          the value of <b>ft * 12</b>. Then uncomment the two lines of code
          below it where indicated.
        </li>
        <li>
          Declare a function named <b>getGramsFromOunces</b> with a parameter
          list containing the parameter <b>ounces</b>. Inside the function,
          return the value of <b>ounces * 28.3495</b>. Below it, outside the
          function, call the <b>getGramsFromOunces</b> function with an argument
          of <b>5</b>, and save its return value to a const variable named
          <b>grams</b>. Uncomment the line that begins with
          <b>document.querySelector...</b> below it.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Bonus Challenge:</b> Create your own function declaration in the
          Bonus Challenge section, and make sure it returns a value of some
          kind. Then call that function and save it to a variable, giving the
          variable an appropriate name. In the very last line in the JS panel,
          replace the variable named <b>yourVariableNameHere</b> with the name
          of the actual variable to which you saved your function's return
          value.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Compare your values shown in the Challenge Question Results table to the
        screenshot shown in the learning portal.
