      <p>Add two more rows to the table in this Codepen, using this data:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The state of California's motto is "Eureka" and the state flower is
          the California poppy.
        </li>
        <li>
          The state of Rhode Island's motto is "Forward" and the state flower is
          the violet.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        NOTE: Tables by default do not have borders around the cells. They have
        been added in this Codepen to make the table more readable, using CSS,
        but don't worry about that for now! We'll get to CSS soon
